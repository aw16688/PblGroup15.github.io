	      The Bohr model.
              The Bohr model is one of the most widely used atomic models. 
	      Like all models it has a nucleus with electrons circling it. 
	      What’s sets the Bohr model apart is its multi-layered representation of the electrons. 
	      It can contain 2 electrons in its first shell, 8 in the second, 32 in the third, and so on and so forth.

		The Rutherford model
                The Rutherford model is similar to the Bohr model, with a central nucleus made of protons and neutrons while electrons fly around it. 
		However the Rutherford model shows the path of each electron.
		This makes it more difficult to use when showing larger atoms, however.
		This makes it less likely to be used when conveying information about the atom.

		The Quantum Mechanical model
                This is the hardest to use model. 
		It still has the same basis as most other models, using a nucleus and outer shell electrons.
		But it displays it in a 3 dimensional shape. 
		Tracking the movements of the electrons in the three dimensional space. 
		This makes it similar to the Rutherford model but adds additional detail to the shape of the orbit of electrons.
		This makes it the hardest to use, as most students (or scientists) are not going to have 3 dimensional rendering technology at their fingertips at all times.

	<h3> TRENDS IN THE PERIODIC TABLE </h3>

	   Atomic Size
           The atomic size of atoms follow a pattern of size depending on where they are of the periodic table.
	   They go from biggest to smallest, from top left to bottom right. 
           However, hydrogen and the inner transition metals are exempt from this rule. 
	   This is because they are placed outside of the periodic table itself.

		Ionization
                It works in reverse of the atomic size, with the larger amounts of ionization being in the upper right corner. 
		Also like atomic size, hydrogen seems to be exempt from this rule. 
		Because they are separate from the periodic table and would fit elsewhere.

	Electronegativity
        This trend is nearly the same as the trend for ionization.
	There is one major difference, however; the noble gases and inner transition metals are missing from this equation, having no electronegativity at all.
	This not because of them belonging inside the periodic table, but rather because the inner transition metals 
	and noble gasses are unable to bond with other atoms and would not have the attraction that causes electronegativity.

	<h3> ELEMENTS, COMPOUNDS, AND MIXTURES </h3>
	<!- Body for topic 3 ->
	<p>Elements are the purest form of any material.
	   They are the single individual basis for all things.
	   Compounds are two or more atoms that have been bound together.
           The compound is then the same combination of elements throughout.
	   It would be like having pure water (H2O). Mixtures are made of many atoms.
	   They have many elements strewn about them, it would be like impure water, having many extra minerals inside of it.
	   Another good example is air; it is mainly nitrogen with some oxygen, but has enough random material to be more than pure nitrogen and oxygen.</p>
